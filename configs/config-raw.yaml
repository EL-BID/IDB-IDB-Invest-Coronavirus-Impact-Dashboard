# This is a configuration file that sets up all the important 
# paramenters to run a Waze normalization pipeline. Most of the 
# time, users just have to modify simple parameters concerning 
# the name of the process `slug` and dates. 


# Name of the process. 
# Everything will be saved under the `slug` name: Athena tables and 
# S3 data. So it is very important that you remember it and that it 
# means something. A resoanable `slug` is the name of the city or 
# region that you are running the pipeline for.

# Pipeline Groups
# Add historical to run full pipeline

# Initial Filters
# They are applied at the first step of the pipeline that extracts data
# from the raw table. Those filters define the universe where all 
# calculations are going to happen.
# If ` - blockingalertuuid is null` is uncommented, then you will delete
# all information about blocked roads. In the standard mode, blocked roads
# are kept in the unbalanced panel, but are not part of the estiamates.
