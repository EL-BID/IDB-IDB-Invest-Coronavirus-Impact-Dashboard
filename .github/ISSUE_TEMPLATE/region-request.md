Hey!

To request new regions you have to generate a .csv with the format of [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rwM3kZEPrpjUwugTQ0kGhkWaqaJ0ZG7o0lH8hjojiHA/edit?usp=sharing) template.

You can just copy the spreadsheet, add your regions and share it back. 

Also, let us know what are your plans with these regions! We might get you some extra help or connect you with similar projects.

We run the pipeline daily. So, after the regions are accepted, expect the output the next day at the same url with the `region_slug` that you set.
